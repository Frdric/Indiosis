Indiosis
========

Indiosis is a collaborative web-platform for industrial symbiosis.


Project Background
------------------

In the field of industrial ecology, industrial symbiosis (IS) plays a strong role in the process of reducing, reusing, recycling and recovering waste (4Rs). The concept of IS engages traditionally separate industries in a collective approach to competitive advantage involving physical exchanges of materials, energy, water, and/or by-products (Chertow, 2004). Lot of work has been done to create eco-industrial parks around the world that have operational industrial symbiosis between facilities. However, most of these symbiotic interactions are fostered on a case-by-case basis by focusing on particular industrial areas. Although this approach is effective, it is time consuming and very localized. Today's information and communication technologies offer great potentials for broader scale IS related projects, essentially through the use of the Internet and the now well established Web 2.0 practices.


Platform Description
--------------------

The Indiosis project seeks to catalyze, facilitate and support industrial symbiosis initiatives. It takes various known practices and technologies from industrial ecology, knowledge management and social networking to create a place where both business managers and industrial ecology experts can collaborate, share common grounds and exchange their concerns (i.e. economic, financial, technical and practical).

The project takes the shape of a web platform build around three main features:

+ Gather and showcase well-known functional types of symbiosis solutions
+ Allow companies to find trustable synergy partners
+ Connect those companies with appropriate industrial symbiosis experts

In addition to being a dynamic knowledge repository, Indiosis uses existing social networks (starting with the new LinkedIn API) in order to facilitate knowledge and experience sharing between business managers and IS practitioners.


What's Next
-----------

The earliest possible Indiosis beta release is expected in 2013.

Indiosis is a PRIME / UNIL project in collaboration with ROI.
