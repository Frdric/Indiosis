Indiosis is a collaborative web-platform for industrial symbiosis.
The project seeks to catalyze, facilitate and support industrial symbiosis initiatives. It takes various known practices and technologies from industrial ecology, knowledge management and social networking to create a place where both business managers and industrial ecology experts can collaborate, share common grounds and exchange their concerns (i.e. economic, financial, technical and practical). 

The project takes the shape of a web platform build around three main features: 
	- Gather and showcase well-known functional types of symbiosis solutions ?
	- Allow companies to find trustable synergy partners ?
	- Connect those companies with appropriate industrial symbiosis experts ?
	
In addition to being a dynamic knowledge repository, Indiosis uses existing social networks (starting with the new LinkedIn API) in order to facilitate knowledge and experience sharing between business managers and IS practitioners. 

Indiosis is a PRIME / Unil project in collaboration with ROI. - www.unil.ch/prime | www.roionline.org
